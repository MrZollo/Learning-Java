A personal repository dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering the Java programming language. This space documents my progress — from understanding the fundamentals to building object-oriented applications and real-world projects.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repo serves as my digital learning hub for Java. It’s a structured collection of:

*   **Code Examples:** Java snippets demonstrating language fundamentals and advanced concepts.
*   **Mini-Projects:** Hands-on programs to strengthen understanding through practice.
*   **Learning Notes:** Explanations, syntax guides, and key takeaways in Markdown format.
*   **Challenges & Exercises:** Solutions from books, courses, and coding challenge platforms.

The goal is to build a well-organized, evolving resource that reflects my growth as a Java developer.
